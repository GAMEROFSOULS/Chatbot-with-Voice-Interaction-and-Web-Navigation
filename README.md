# Chatbot with Voice Interaction and Web Navigation

This project is a simple Python-based chatbot that can interact with users via both text and voice. It also allows users to open popular websites like Google, LinkedIn, GitHub, and YouTube using voice commands. The graphical user interface (GUI) is built using Tkinter.

## Features

- **Text-to-Speech**: The chatbot can speak its responses to the user.
- **Speech-to-Text**: Users can give voice commands, which the chatbot will understand and respond to.
- **Web Navigation**: Voice commands can be used to open popular websites like Google, LinkedIn, GitHub, and YouTube.
- **GUI Interface**: A simple and intuitive graphical interface for interacting with the chatbot.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, you need to have the following Python libraries installed:

- `tkinter`: For the GUI interface (comes pre-installed with Python).
- `pyttsx3`: For text-to-speech conversion.
- `speech_recognition`: For speech-to-text conversion.
- `webbrowser`: For opening web pages (comes pre-installed with Python).

You can install the necessary libraries using pip:
